    Stroke pathway processes.

    The pathway is set up using a simpy Environment and
    an instance of the Scenario class (for constants and
    model types). The pathway is used to process patient
    details in the Patient class. Each method in this
    pathway acts on one patient instance at a time.

    Attributes
    ----------

    complete_patients: list

        completed patient journey.

    env: SimPy environment object
        SimPy environment passed to the pathway.

    scenario: Scenario object
        Class containing global variables for the pathway.
